            Lay on a flat bench, gripping dumbbells in each hand. Press the weights up above your chest, 
            keeping them from touching, with your pinkies turned slightly inward. Maintain full body tension 
            on the bench.

            Lower your arms down moving only at your shoulders, keeping a slight elbow bend. Only go as deep as your 
            shoulder mobility allows. Squeeze your shoulder blades to raise the weight back up to the starting position, 
            and emphasize the squeeze in your chest at the top.
