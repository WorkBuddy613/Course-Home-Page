                <p> Sure, we just talked about branching out beyond the bench press. But you can't avoid the exercise if you're 
                    serious about training—or even if you just step foot into any typical strength facility in the world. The move
                    is standard for a reason: it works. Let's break it down with dumbbells for some variety.Do it: This hypertrophy 
                    method means you're more focused on building muscle than pressing max weight, so keep your butt on the bench, with 
                    your feet flat on the floor and your glutes and core engaged. You should also drive your shoulder blades down into 
                    the bench.Lift your dumbbells up, squeezing the handles tightly. Once your back is on the bench, don't just hold
                    the weights with your elbows parallel to your shoulders. Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to help to keep your
                    shoulders safe. Squeeze your chest to drive the weight up, then lower under control under the same path to just above 
                    your chest. Drive back up to hit another rep.
